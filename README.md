# demooni 😈
Routing daemons - a detailed and accurate visual representation of how packets flow on the web. This is **not** a game.

## The Theory of Daemons
Something called routing daemons (demooni) throw packets (pakeetti) from one point to another. This way your favorite web sites, videos and pictures are delivered onto your computer.

The UI consists of two buttons and a number field. You can input the desired packet interval into the field. The program then simulates packet flow
with that value as the latency. The red SOS button can be used to terminate all the routing daemons. Watch out! It also makes the dogs and monkeys explode,
so be careful! The arrow button changes the theme. Read more about themes below.

### Daemons and packets
As told in the Theory of Daemons, the daemons (demoonit) represent the routing daemons (reititysdemoonit) that route packets (pakeetti) on the internet. They catch a packet sent to them and pass it forward with their hands. After a while when the internet has been up for too long, the number is routing daemons has grown substantially high. That's when the internet starts to become slow. The daemons need to be killed. The user can kill individual daemons by clicking on them or just rest assured some will die naturally. Read more about this below.

### Dog theme
The daemons might appear frightening. That's why this package includes a dog (hauveli) theme, where the daemons are replaced by dogs and the packet with a ball.
This mode also aims to be an accurate representation on internet packet flow but there is one problem, *the dogs are so keen on the ball, they try to fetch it*.

### Monkey theme
Not everyone likes dogs, so there is also a mode that has monkeys (apiina) and bananas (banaani). Dogs were intrigued by the ball and followed it,
so that mode is not very accurate. The monkeys don't seem to like the banana that much, so they pass it around, *similarly to a packet.*

### Monkey God
The Monkey God (Apiina Jumaala) is absolute and doesn't like daemons. The monkey society is under threat as the daemons are amongs them.
The Monkey God protects them by killing all the evil daemons if there are too many. The Monkey God likes dogs.
