## The Theory of Daemons
Something called routing daemons (demooni) throw packets (pakeetti) from one point to another. This way your favorite web site is delivered onto your computer.

```

```
2. Open `index.html` locally with your web browser or upload it onto a web server.

## Dog theme
The daemons might appear frightening. That's why this package includes a dog theme, where the daemons are replaced by dogs and the packet with a ball.
This mode also aims to be an accurate representation on internet packet flow but there is one problem, *the dogs are so keen on the ball, they try to fetch it*.
